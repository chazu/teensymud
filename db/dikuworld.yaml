      You see here a cozy little room with a fireplace.  You can tell it is Moses'
      room by the two stone tablets and a bible on a small ledge near the fireplace.
      This room was designed for total relaxation.  You can watch television, listen
      to the stereo, even soak in a hot tub.
      There is a bell here for the butler.

      You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Midgaard.
      The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
      appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
      picturing Gods, Giants and peasants.
         Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
      mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.

      You are in a huge hall.  A beautiful chandelier is hanging from the roof
      and many closets are standing against the walls.  Bearskin covers the floor
      and looks like a nice place to rest.

      You have arrived to Mapmaker's living room.  There's a fireplace on the
      western wall and standing by it is a huge book-shelf.  In the middle of the
      room is a purple sofa (what a terrible color) and near it against the wall
      is Mapmaker's working table.

      You are standing on the plains. This is a vast desolate place where the
      wind can howl undisturbed since nothing but you barrs its way. However you
      are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left a small path.
      The path looks rather bewildered and is not the kind of path to lead to
      anywhere significant or important but it seems to have made up its mind to
      enter the hills far away north.

      This is where the Midgaard Road turns north and away from the city.  To the
      west, the road continues towards what looks like a fairly large city.  The
      mute sounds of city commotion reach your ears from a distance; stray dogs
      barking, children crying, and street salesmen shouting.  To the east, you can
      see the stately oaks and poplars of the holy grove

      You stand on the outskirts of a large city - Midgaard; the capital of this
      land. The road leads east into the peace and quiet - and dangers - of the
      forest; and to the west it becomes the main street of the town; surrounded by
      a confusion of shops, bars, and market places.

      You are on a small bewildered path winding its way between the hills in
      lack of better things to do. To the south you have a splendid view over the
      flat, vast, desolate plains. To the north the hills grow steadily darker and
      foreboding. This is the cause of no sunset, it is rather the power of evil
      penetrating these quiet hills. Glancing around you notice only a single bird.

      You are surrounded by dark and sinister hills. Although they seemed fairly
      small from a distance you now get the feeling that they're closing in on you,
      towering over you, overwhelming you...
      The small path seems to have second thoughts about these hills because it
      starts winding unnecessarily, turning several times around itself.
      To the south the hills have a lighter hue of dark. To the north however, the
      hills have become nightblack holes in the distant mountains.

      At this point the path has had enough. With a terrified shudder it cowers
      to the ground, only staying here because you're standing on it. with a slight
      feeling of unease you look around noticing only a few bushes and a large sign
      carved into the mountain.
      You feel you can hear the cry of help from a thousand silent voices all coming
      from an even darker hole in the mountain to the north marking the entrance to
      a cave (or a grave :-).

      You are in a large cave. The ceiling is lost somewhere above the reach of
      your light. The floor, however, is highly illuminated, your light flickering
      over several tombstones. Only one is whole, the rest have been shattered by
      some savage blow. The remaining tombstone looks disturbingly new...
      A small breeze of fresh air enters from the south (probably lost too). Take a
      good breath, it may be your last mouthful of air in a long, long time that
      others haven't breathed before you.
      To the north a small tunnel continues into the mountain.

      You squeeze your way through a small, narrow tunnel. The sharp-edged rocks
      protruding from the walls threathen to scratch and cut you. 
      To the south you sense a freshness in the air which is rather unusual in these
      damp, stuffy tunnels. To the north the tunnel continues.

      You are in a part of the tunnel that looks uncannily like the rest except
      that it goes in a east-north direction. To the north the tunnel widens into
      a cave.

      This tunnel, leading east-west, seems to be seldomly used. A thick layer
      of dust covers the floor making the air stuffy and dry.

      You are walking in a narrow tunnel. The walls are only roughly shaped,
      sharp rocks protruding everywhere, even from the floor making you stumble in
      the flickering light. To the south the tunnel narrows even more making it
      almost impossible to pass. To the north it slowly widens into a cave. There
      is a branch of the tunnel going west.

      You are balancing carefully on the giant sticky threads that holds the giant
      web in place.  To the east is a giant tree trunk and to the west is an entrance
      to a cave-like structure made from many layers of spider web.

      You are inside a cave-like structure that seems to be made entirely from

      it hard to breathe the foul air that lingers here.  The walls are covered with
      open cocoons.

      You stand in a bend of the pipe system of the sewer with mud up to your
      thighs. Contemplating a higher level of existence here would be utterly
      inappropriate, as the smell would keep any intelligent creature from even
      thinking of anything but getting away from this foul end of the WORLD.
      The bend goes from north to west.

      You are standing by an old and worn well from before this century. The sewer
      leads to the east from here and the well leads down into darkness. Metal
      bars implanted in the side of the well lead down as a ladder.

      This one seems interesting, a big difference from all the other junctions.
      It seems cleaner than the rest of them. Weird. Something that looks like 
      an air shaft leads upwards, but it looks far too slippery to climb.
      The pipes lead to the south, west and north.

      You can't see much here but the echo tells you that there's quite a drop
      down. You can just make out a huge dark pool out there in the darkness, 
      mostly because of the trickling of water. The water from the sewer actually
      washes over this ledge and makes it quite slippery. From here it drops, 
      like a waterfall, into the pool far down.

      You stand in a small room with a great big opening in the ceiling. From this

      falling sludge. To the east there is an entryway leading out from here and 
      it seems absolutely impossible to force the muddy decent.

      You are in the progress of walking all the way around the ledge since there's
      no way of turning around on this all too narrow path. There IS another exit
      from here but that leads right into mid-air and with high probability of a
      free fall session afterwards.

      This seems like a ledge that is a little broader than the one just to the 
      north of here. The ledge seems to lead around some sort of Abyss of total 
      darkness. The ledge seems to have an odd-looking edge here.

      You stand in a rather odd intersection of pipes. The pipes actually don't
      resemble pipes anymore. They look more like a real stone tunnel, or a
      passageway hewn directly into the rock. The ways from here lead north, east
      and west.

      You've just stepped into the most unlucky position in the whole of DikuMUD.
      The result of such a foolish act should be punished with death, you know.
      With an acceleration of approximately 9.82 metres per second per second, you
      are now descending the Abyss. What awaits you at the bottom will continue to

      You are standing on a ledge that seems quite a lot larger than the rest 
      of the ledges. This one leads to the west and the east, plus it has an exit
      going to the south. Though you could jump into mid-air, but it probably 
      wouldn't be such a good idea. The way south is in utter darkness.

      You are standing in a middle of a square room. Along the walls skeletons 
      are hanging in rusty chains. In the middle of the room there is a big metal 
      box, covered with dust. To the south you can just make out a small exit.

      You are standing in a lot of mud. A disguisting smell surrounds
      the place, and makes you fell sick. Small flames sometimes shoot
      up from the hot mud. To the west there is a small door. To the 
      north you can see an iron door.

      This is an utterly silent place. As you look around you see that there
      hasn't been a living thing in a long time. The dust lies here in a thick
      layer on the floor and on the furniture. On the wall hangs a bleak and 
      worn tapestry. A winding stone staircase leads up into darkness. On the 
      wall to the west you can see a huge torch stuck into the solid rock.
      A large portcullis blocks your way to the north.

      You are standing in dust. This place has not been
      touched for a long time. Otherwise it is quite boring
      here, looks like a place to rest! To the west you see
      the outline of a door. A tunnel leads to the east.

      A huge cloud forms the plateau on which you are now standing. The wind here
      is absolutely quiet and the sun is shining warmly upon you. From under the

      Redferne.

      You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the
      light comes, is a mystery. The walls seem to radiate warmth and give
      the pleasent feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
      on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
      To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
      shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
      north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
      looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
      this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

      This is truly a magnificent place! Books and scrolls lie together on every
      shelf. A large globe, with the map of the Mud-world upon it, stands in the
      dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
      looking leather arm-chairs adourn the center of the library together with
      a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
      hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
      east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the
      west wall.

      You are standing in the northern end of the huge hall. This part is under
      the grand wooden staircase so the light seems a little less bright here,
      but this doesn't bother your sight at all. To the north lies the kitchen.
      To the south lies the Southern end of the hall. To the east there is a huge
      metal door. To the west there is a large aspenwood door.

      This must be the place of food and drink. You can hear the faint noise of

      You can see food all over. Among the heaps of food you notice HUGE rats

      You can see up and down the stairway. It seems to take forever, either going
      up OR down. It's just a seemingly insurmountable climb, either way. Up is the 
      bedroom of Redferne, and Down leads to the Southern end of the hall.

      This is a snugly set bedroom with all the necessities for a romantic evening.
      A large fireplace adourns the east wall, and sizzling away is the wood that
      is ablaze within. The bed is enormous, covering at least HALF of this great
      room. This stretches at least 140 square feet, so can you imagine the BED?
      A large staircase leads down to the hall. A couple of doors open up to a
      broad balcony to the south.

      You see a splendid of the most of this world. The valleys stretch as far as

      This looks like the cage in which a large carnivor is being kept. Judging by
      the state the walls are in, this could very well be a large AGGRESSIVE animal. 
      This makes you pretty insecure, this stating your feeling about the place, 
      quite mildly.

      This place has quite a good view over Midgaard. Your possibilities of movement
      seems to extend only to up and down. Unless you want to let go of the secure
      and seemingly unmoveable chain, then those are the directions you should take
      from here.

      Hanging on to the chain you figure out that there's no way of leaving down 
      from here. The wind pulls you from left to right and back. This seems like a
      totally impossible task. The ascend is the only way ahead for you.
      Otherwise you would risk death by falling to the hard ground below. DO NOT
      DESCEND NOW OR YOU'LL SURELY DIE!!!!

      You are approximately on the middle of the treacherous Chain. One false step
      and death will come and collect you quickly. The chain leads upwards and down.
      No way are you going to descend now... You've only just begun your climb.
      Besides it could cost you your life. Look down and you'll see why.

      As you descend, the chain seems to absorbe all weather around it, making it
      swing less and less in the very powerful wind tearing at it. The Chain seems
      to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
      originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
      It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
                 ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
      The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.

      This place truly a splendid view of the WHOLE COUNTRY SIDE!!! A magnificent
      light shines upon you and the way up through the clouds is opened. Up there
      you can now see the Mansion of Naris, Residence of the Greater God Redferne.
      The chain beneath you seems to evaporate in the mustering clouds that
      surround you by now.

      You are standing on what appears to be an expanse of black
      glass. Beneath your feet perfectly straight lines form enormous,
      web-like patterns, glowing with a bluish-green light. The sky is
      a uniform pale grey, and the horizon seem to be much too close.
         To the east, a wide crack in the glass gapes hungrily.

      You are standing in a long corridor, curving north and west. There 
      is a noticeable layer of fine dust covering everything here. The 
      grey-painted walls are flaking, revealing more of the glass-like 
      material that also covers the ground above. There is a wide crack in 
      the ceiling above, but it is too high for you to reach.

      worm-like things, snaking out from the cracked glass, sparking madly.

      This is the Daemon's Lair. It is suffused in a purple glow from 
      the myriad multishaped and -sized screens covering most of three 
      walls. There is a rung ladder on the only uncluttered wall, going 
      up through a shaft in the ceiling. There is an easy chair, a 
      rumpled bed and a table piled high with yestercycle's dirty dishes. 
      In the wall to the west, a tunnel leads out to the Matrix Fault.

      You are in the north end of a connecting hallway, tastefully decorated with
      oak paneling and the coat-of-arms of various famous nobles hung on the walls.
      The hallway leads south, and there is a door in the eastern wall.

      You are in the blue room, one of the guest rooms in Dragon's mansion. The
      walls are (surprise!) blue, and the rest of the room is decorated in similar
      shades, producing a very nice, cool effect. There is a large bed and a
      matching set of sofas, easy-chairs and a coffee table. Through the venetian
      blinds in front of the large east window you can see the edge of the grove.

      You are standing in the south end of the hallway. There are doors in the

      You are in the red room, one of the guest rooms in Dragons's mansion. The
      walls are wallpapered a deep warm red, and dark mahogany panelling nicely com-
      plements them. There is a large, warm waterbed and a sofa group in dark wood
      with leather upholstery, including a coffee table. Heavy brown curtains are
      pulled away from the wide windows, to reveal a nice view towards the grove.

      You are standing in the middle of Dragon's kitchen. Contrary to popular
      belief, He *Doesn't* eat virgins, which is amply demonstrated by the large
      variety of foodstuffs found here on the shelves. There are numerous cans of
      tomatoes, peas, corn etc., vines of garlic, a *Huge* array of small spice jars
      along several shelves and a large combo refrigerator/freezer. A big oven and
      stove is lurking in a corner. There is some proof here that Dragon is a less
      than meticulous housekeeper... There are doors to the north and west.

      You are standing in the middle of a vast palisander floor. This is where
      Dragon entertains large number of guests, but the cloth-covered chairs
      standing forlornly in a corner suggests that this does not happen often.
      There are doors in the south and west walls, while to the east there is a
      short corridor to the greenhouse.

      This is Dragons' greenhouse. Green light filters in slantwise through the
      plants, giving the room a subtropical ambience. It is not really hot in here,
      though, rather a pleasantly warm temperature. The walls are all windows, except 
      the eastern one joining the greenhouse to the main building, but it is hard to 
      see out for all the greenery here. There is a set of easy-chairs and a glass
      coffee table. To the south, there is a wide double door out to a sunlit 
      terrace.

      This is Dragons' dining hall. There is a large long solid oak table,
      seating at least 24, with heavy, wooden chairs to match. The oak panel walls
      are filled with paintings. There are doors to the north and east, and to the
      west there is a wide double door opening out onto the sunlit terrace.

      You are standing on a sunlit terrace in front of Dragon's mansion. To the
      west, there is a splendid view over the field down over the lake. To the north
      is the greenhouse, its large windowpanes shimmering with weird and wonderful
      colors, while a double door leads into the house proper to the east. It is
      warm and calm here. There is a white-painted table with a parasol here,
      together with a matched set of chairs.

      The slope leads up to a portal, through which you can see a swirling 
      grey fog, shot through with lightening. Occasionally a tendril of fog 
      snakes out, looking as if sniffing, then withdraws with a shudder. From 
      within, a faint wailing can be heard, as if from souls in agony.
